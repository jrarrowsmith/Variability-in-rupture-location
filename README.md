# Variability-in-rupture-location
Variability in rupture location over the ~100 m-scale based on a formalized analysis of past paleoseismic trenching studies

Matlab-based tools for compilation of metadata and fracture data from scaled paleoseismic trench logs.

Main script is PGE_trenches_faults_v3_no_georef.m 
To post process the data, use read_summary.m
